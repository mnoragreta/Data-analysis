# Data-science-portfolio
This is my portfolio, which contains my Data Analysis Projects using Python for statistical analysis, data visualisation, model prediction. 

My nickname is Lily and I am a Project Manager aiming to be turned Data Analyst. While working as a project manager, I often faced teh situation that high level managers above me took business decisions without observing the data, project outcomes in details or the opposite: management check the data in those field which is not relevant to the daily business itself. At this point started to feel even stronger desire to collect, analyze, deal with data than before. As a result, I realized I wanted to switch my career and become a Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I possess analytical skills, a goal-oriented mindset, and an assertive personality, along with strong technical and interpersonal skills required to find solutions when needed. I enjoy taking up new challenges, and analyzing data is one of my favorite activities, as it presents me with new challenges every day.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my projects showcasing my expertise in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and data visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to formulate clear problem statements, explore and preprocess data, select appropriate algorithms, and interpret results to provide meaningful recommendations.

Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodel, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow.keras.
