# Data-science-portfolio
This is my portfolio, which contains my Data Analysis Projects using Python for statistical analysis, data visualisation, model prediction. 

My name is Nora Greta and I am a Project Manager aiming to be turned Data Scientist. During my10 years experience, I often faced the situation that high level managers above me took business decisions without observing the data, project outcomes in details or the opposite: management check the data in those field which is not relevant to the daily business itself. At this point started to feel even stronger desire to collect, analyze, deal with data than before. As a result, I realized I wanted to switch my career and become a Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I possess analytical skills, a goal-oriented mindset, and an assertive personality, along with strong technical and interpersonal skills required to find solutions when needed. I enjoy taking up new challenges, and analyzing data is one of my favorite activities, as it presents me with new challenges every day.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my projects showcasing my expertise in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and data visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to formulate clear problem statements, explore and preprocess data, select appropriate algorithms, and interpret results to provide meaningful recommendations.

Foodhub
A food aggregator company FoodHub want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Generating business insight for marketing purposes, based on insights recommendation also articualted in the ppt file. 
Data analysis, preprocessing, data visualisation. 
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 

Bellabeat: 
The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. Generating business insight (customers behaviour, trends) for marketing purposes and based on insights recommendation also articualted in the ppt file. 
Data analysis, preprocessing, data visualisation, model building, feature engineering. 
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn: solid machine learning steps such as handling missing values, choosing the best model: DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, CatBoostRegressor.

Bishkek
Dataset about the air in Bishkek. The idea is to be able to predict for the column 'AQI Category', basically to understand how healthy or polluted air can be expected.
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, model building, feature engineering.
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn: RandomForestClassifier, machine learning steps such as handling missing values by CatBoostRegressor, LightGBM Classifier


Melanoma
Dataset of patients with malignant melanoma with measurement of thickness of the tumour and ulcer-  important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. 
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, model building, feature engineering, satistical analysis, hypothesis testing and regression.
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: high-level functions, statsmodel, scikit-learn: RandomForestClassifier

Credit Card
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Highly imbalanced dataset. Undersampled and oversampled dataset transformation - cleaned from outliers and perform logistic regression on them in order to compare the results.
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, under and oversampling, scaling, model building and evalutation.
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn: logistics regression, isolation forest, RandomForestClassifier, standardscaler.

Salary
Dataset about Salaries per education level, gender, department, bonus. 
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, statistical analysis: hypothesis testing, Anova, Chi-squared, regression. 
Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodel: scipy, pingouin, bioinfokit. 

Product demand
Dataset on quantity of a given a product to stock is a major for wholesale and retail business. Conducting time series analysis.
Data cleaning, data preprocessing, time series analysis.
Libraries & functions used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodel: adfuller hypothesis testing, arima, auto-arima, sarimax, seaconal decompose & forecasting.
